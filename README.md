# Big-Ideas-Final
    Team Name: Big Macs -- Group Number: 29

    Team Members: Matthew Morrocco msm143@pitt.edu, Sam Meyers sam540@pitt.edu, Foster Stravino fws6@pitt.edu

    The datasets were divided among the group as follows:
    Matt had the Community dataset
    Sam had the Safety dataset
    Foster had the Education dataset

    For community we used the household type data found here: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-data-household-types
    This dataset provides information on the amount of households in the different neighborhoods of the city of Pittsburgh and then classifies them based on how homeowners identified there households based on the 2015 American Community Survey

    For safety we used arrest data for the city of Pittsburgh found here: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data
    This shows the information documented of people taken into custody. This data only includes the arrests documented by the City of Pittsburgh Police and does NOT include any arrest made by other police departments. It includes time of arrest, location, and arrest type

    For education we used the amount of enrolled students in each neighborhood found here: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-2015-school-enrollment
    This information was also gathered from the American Community Suvey from 2015. The dataset provides enrollment given by race and includes a section of all races. 

    This repository is meant to combine and analyze data of different metrics for the different neighborhoods to determine a "best" neighborhood in the city, so by looking at the 3 selected aspects, community, education, and race, we were able to compare neighborhoods to find a "best" one.
