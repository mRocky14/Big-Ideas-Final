A good neighborhood should have a strong community
One way to measure this is to analyze how many families a neighborhood has
Families are a good representative on community because children will play together and parents will talk to each other
This strengthens community and relationships within a neighborhood indicating a healthier environment
Also is a neighborhood is not great for raising a family, the number should be lower indicating a less supportive community
The data used for this analysis is HHDATA.csv, a renamed file taken from this link: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-american-community-survey-data-household-types/resource/74deca7d-b398-4137-83d7-553a7162f464
